# FriendFinder

This is an app similar to ones like match.com and e-Harmony.

The first page is an intro page inviting you to try the matching survey.
There are 2 links at the bottom, API link to show you the possible friends you can be matched with,
and one that brings you to the github repo where the code for this app is stored.

Clicking on the Go To Survey brings you the survey page.
Each input is a required one, name, picture and responses for each of the 10 questions.
If you miss any of the 10 questions or name and picture fields, a pop-up will appear stating you missed an input.

Once all inputs are done, click on the submit button to see your match.

There are also 2 links at the bottom of this page exactly the same as the ones on the first page.
